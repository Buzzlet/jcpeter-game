* Drawing
  Draw arbitrary textures inside rectangles

* Physics
  - Move continuously, test for collisions (simple, no sliding (box<->box)

* Logic
  - Key presses --> movement, attacking, etc
  - Mouse movement --> change in direction?
  - Generate "dungeons" (grids of rooms)
  
* Sprite
  - Collision box
  - Optional texture (4 of them preferably)
  - Direction it's facing
