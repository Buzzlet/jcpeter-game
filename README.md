# jcpeter-game
This game is a dungeon escape game (currently untitled) which began development under Joel Ristvedt, Caleb Ristvedt, and Peter Deberny as a project for the Concordia University, Nebraska Computer Science club. After the initial concept was completed, Joel continued to work on the game as his own personal endeavor. 

The game is currently in need of a name. Have an idea? Send it my way!

The game also can use suggestions from anyone, and all advice is welcome!

All current assets are placeholders and will be replaced when the game is starting to fall into place. If you have assets, are competent at making assets, or have ideas for future assets, hit me up!

The project is being developed using Processing (python mode). To get processing visit processing.org. Other than some built-in utilities and convenient drawing functionality, the project is written in readable Python.
